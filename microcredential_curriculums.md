Course overview

### Content marketing is RELENTLESS.

On most days, you're just drowning in content tasks.

Like it feels as if you just wrote your newsletter and it's already time to write another one.

Your audience needs another touchpoint and the social media monster needs feeding.

So much content to create. Yet you still need find time to do everything else. This business or career isn't gonna grow itself.

Do you dream of being the prolific creator you always wanted to be, but without spending dozens of hours each week keeping up?

I did. A lot. (And I'm a fast writer, even.)

Now, imagine this...

You wake up tomorrow to a message --- your AI assistant has already curated the best trending topics for your niche.

It's ready to draft your next newsletter in YOUR writing style. Just click a button.

Once your AI employee is done with their work (takes under 1 minute), all you need is 10 minutes to polish and then you hit "send."

You're not done though.

You need a LinkedIn post. So you simply scan the AI agent's daily suggestions you haven't used yet.

You find something you think has the most potential, drop in a few lines of your own POV, click, and BOOM...

Another first draft that's already 90% of the way there.

---AND that's infused with your writing style and POV.

Content needs? Done in 10% of the usual time.

✔︎ No more stressing on what to write about, day in, day out.

✔︎ No more hours drained each day to meet your content goals.

✔︎ No more letting yourself down by missing posting days.

This isn't a dream.

This is the system you get with AI Agents for Content Creators.

I got sick and tired of falling behind on content.

Hi, I'm Rob Lennon.

Two and half years ago, I was exactly where you are --- overworked and secretly wondering if I'd ever catch up on the infinite treadmill of content creation.

I'd had multi-month breaks in sending my newsletter because it was just too much work to fit it in with everything else.

I'd go over a week without a post on social sometimes.

This left me wondering whether building an audience-based business was really something I ought to be doing.

Yet I knew that having an audience gives you insane leverage. It's the most powerful marketing asset you can have.

Plus, I had so much knowledge to share.

There had to be some way to make it work. Especially with all my knowledge of AI.

It wasn't a question of "if" AI can help, but of quality---

Of course AI can help you write.

But the content has to *sound like you*.

It has to be *worth reading*.

And to keep up with social and email, there has to be *a lot of it* without sounding repetitive.

This is a hard problem to solve properly with AI without sacrificing quality. I've been working on it for a LONG TIME.

I've spent the last two-and-a-half years mastering prompt engineering, learning no-code automation, and building AI-powered content systems that have gradually gotten better and better.

Last year, I hit AI-assisted, HUMAN-GRADE quality with my writing system.

But while I managed to hit my quality benchmark with the generated content, the process was too complex for non-prompt engineers.

I struggled to teach it and help others adopt it.

This was Content Reactor 3.0... insanely powerful, but also too much prompt engineering for most people.

I realized that there needs to be a plug-and-play version for content creators.

Something based on automation blueprints you can copy and put to use yourself.

A new system that just works. And that makes it EASY.

Almost like having your own content app, except you can customize the prompts and workflows if you want...

So, this year, after tons of trial-and-error, I finally built it, a 3-part workflow---

- Listeners to gather ideas

- Co-Writers to draft in your writing style

- Automations to run the system for you

...This is a team of AI workflow agents that work for free to generate content, day in, day out.

It was like turning on a faucet of endless, awesome social posts and emails.

Now, I (with some trepidation, because this is powerful stuff) am offering to hand you that same faucet.

Welcome to AI Agents for Content Creators.
