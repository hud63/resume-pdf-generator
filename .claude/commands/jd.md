5. **Create the output files:**
   - Extract job title from JD and format as CamelCase (e.g., "CRM Acquisition Manager" ‚Üí "CRMAcquisitionManager")
   - Generate filename using format: `MarkCetola_JobTitle.md` (remove spaces, special characters, use CamelCase)
   - Save the tailored resume as a temporary markdown file
   - Convert to PDF using: `python simple_pdf_converter.py MarkCetola_JobTitle.md`
   - Delete the temporary markdown file after PDF creation
   - Final output: `MarkCetola_JobTitle.pdf`
