\#\# STRENGTHS

\#\#\#\#\# PUZZLES, NOT PROBLEMS

Problem-solving has been an integral aspect of my career to date,  
whether it be understanding a particular legal issue, collaborating  
with stakeholders to adapt the wording on marketing material, or  
developing innovative ways to generate an ideal outcome for a  
prospective client. I constantly focus on ways to improve processes  
and get things done more efficiently to go further, faster.

\#\#\#\#\# CONNECTING THE DOTS

\`\`\`  
I am skilled at understanding complex ideas and filtering key points  
from large amounts of information, understanding my audience, and  
individualising my messaging to ensure it is delivered clearly and  
concisely. I am equally comfortable writing a summary of the facts  
and giving pragmatic and commercial advice, voicing my opinion to  
influence stakeholders in cross discipline project teams, and  
speaking in front of large or small groups of people.
